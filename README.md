# Project Object Detection
## Description :

It’s a tutored project made in second year of a two-year university diploma in computer science at UCA.

During this project, we tried to make a machine learning model to recognize objects such as pedestrians and vehicles in an urban setting.
We were focused on learning how the different state-of-the-art technologies work in machine learning to make the best model we could. We started by splitting the subject between segmentation techniques and classification techniques.

We toggled multiple techniques of computer vision and machine learning such as multi-layer perceptrons and convolutional neural networks. For segmentation, the subject was split into different categories of methods: region-based segmentation, edge-based segmentation and thresholding. Another widely used category of methods, that we decided not to toggle at first, is AI based techniques of segmentation.

Every week, we would report our progress during our meetings with our advisor, [Chafik SAMIR](https://limos.fr/detailperson/40) and see what we would toggle the following week.

This allowed us to learn about a lot of techniques that will not be explained in detail in this part but can be read about with further details previously.

Our final model combined the best methods we had seen in segmentation and classification to make one final model supposed to allow us to reach our objective. This final model however still struggles to produce convincing results and will need to be improved upon to produce better results.
